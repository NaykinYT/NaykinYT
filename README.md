## About

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at EPFL with a strong interest in **machine learning, graph algorithms, and principled optimization methods**.

My work focuses on combining structural reasoning with scalable computational techniques, particularly in SAT-based methods, learning systems, and data-driven modeling.

This profile highlights selected research projects and technical work.
