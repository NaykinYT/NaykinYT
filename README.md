## About

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at EPFL with research interests in **Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and graph algorithms**, with a particular focus on principled optimization and structural methods.

I am currently a Research Assistant at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Biological Systems, where I work on applied machine learning models to predict behavioral responses from neuronal activity.

My work combines scalable learning systems with rigorous algorithmic reasoning, with applications ranging from large language model fine-tuning to SAT-based graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization.

This profile highlights selected research projects, publications, and technical work.
