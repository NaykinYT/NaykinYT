## About

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at EPFL with research interests in **Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and graph algorithms**, with a particular focus on principled optimization and structural methods.

My work combines scalable learning systems with rigorous algorithmic reasoning, spanning large language model fine-tuning, SAT-based methods, and combinatorial optimization.

This profile highlights selected research projects, publications, and technical work.
